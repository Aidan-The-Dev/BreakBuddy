# BreakBuddy

## What’s this?

**BreakBuddy** is a BetterDiscord plugin that helps remind you to take breaks and stretch at customizable intervals. It's perfect for anyone who spends long hours in front of a screen and wants to stay healthy and productive!

You can set how often you want to be reminded to take a break, and BreakBuddy will show you a friendly pop-up when it’s time to step away for a minute.

## Features

- **Set Your Own Break Interval:** Choose how often you want to be reminded to take a break (between 5 and 120 minutes).
- **Break Reminders:** A pop-up will appear when it’s time to take a break with a message to remind you to stretch!
- **Easy-to-Use Settings:** Just use the settings panel to change the reminder interval.
- **Saves Your Settings:** No need to reset your interval every time, it saves your preferences.

## How to Install

1. **Download the Plugin:**
   - Get the plugin from [GitHub here](https://github.com/Aidan-The-Dev/BreakBuddy) or from the BetterDiscord website.

2. **Install the Plugin:**
   - Open Discord, then click the gear icon at the bottom left to open **User Settings**.
   - Scroll down to **BetterDiscord** and click on the **Plugins** tab.
   - Click **Open Plugins Folder** (Folder icon in the top left) and place the `BreakBuddy.plugin.js` file you downloaded in that folder.

3. **Enable the Plugin:**
   - Head back to Discord and under the **Plugins** tab, find **BreakBuddy** and click the switch to enable it.

## How to Use

Once BreakBuddy is installed and enabled, you can set how often you want to be reminded to take a break:

1. Open **User Settings** in Discord.
2. Go to **BetterDiscord** > **Plugins**.
3. Find **BreakBuddy** and click on the settings icon to open the settings panel.
4. Use the slider to set how often you want to be reminded (in minutes).
5. Hit **Save**, and you’re good to go!

When the timer runs out, a little reminder will pop up telling you to stretch and take a quick break.

## Customization

You can adjust how often the reminders pop up by simply dragging the slider in the settings panel. Choose an interval anywhere between **5** and **120 minutes** – it’s all up to you!

## Things to Keep in Mind

- Your settings will stay saved even if you restart Discord or reload the plugin.
- This plugin works only with **BetterDiscord**. So if you don’t have BetterDiscord installed yet, you’ll need that to use this plugin.

## Having Trouble?

If something isn’t working:
- Make sure you’ve got **BetterDiscord** installed and working.
- Double-check that **BreakBuddy** is enabled in the plugin settings.
- Try restarting Discord if you don’t see the plugin working.
